## Overview

There may be times when using Gesmew that the documentation doesn't answer all
the questions you may have. There are several other places on the internet where
you can go to ask Gesmew questions, and they are covered in this guide.

## Mailing List

The first of these places is our [Google Groups mailing
list](http://groups.google.com/group/gesmew-user). On this list, any user may ask
any question about Gesmew and it's up to the community to answer it, or in some
cases, a Gesmew employee may answer the question.

This list is perfect for *general* questions about Gesmew. If you think you have
discovered a bug in Gesmew, please [file an issue on GitHub](#github-issues).

Questions on this list may take some time to answer, so please be patient when
asking them.

## Gitter

Gesmew has a [Gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/gesmew/gesmew) similar to IRC that
can be used to discuss Gesmew in real-time. We prefer using Gitter over IRC for the chat logs, notifications, and other features.

## IRC Channel

The IRC channel for Gesmew is at #gesmew on irc.freenode.net. Here you can talk to
other users of Gesmew in real-time. Gesmew employees are represented in the channel with a `@` before their name on most clients.

If you do not have an IRC client and still want to join the discussion, Freenode offers a webchat solution for their network. [Simply visit this link, enter your username and connect!](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#gesmew)

It is recommended that for people using IRC often, or on multiple networks that they download an IRC client. Popular IRC clients include: [Quassel (all platforms)](http://quassel-irc.org/), [XChat (windows and linux)](http://xchat.org/) and [mIRC (windows only)](http://www.mirc.com/).

title: Gesmew 1.1.0
section: version
---

# Summary

This is the official 1.1 Release of Gesmew. This is a minor release, and
so backwards compatibility with extensions and applications is mostly
guaranteed. There may still be some changes required for your extensions
or applications, and so please read the changelog below to know if you
are affected.

If any particular extension your store uses is not yet compatible you
are encouraged to alert the Gesmew team about it by filing an issue on
that extension project if it's an official extension, or to submit a
patch to that project to upgrade compatibility.

# Major changes (backwards incompatibility)

## Support for Rails 3.2.x only

Support for Rails 3.1.x is dropped. Rails 3.2.x offers performance boost
in development
mode and is the first-class supported platform for 1.1.x release cycles.
It is recommended
that you use the latest version 3.2.3. Please upgrade your Rails before
bumping Gesmew gem by modifying your Gemfile:

```bash
gem 'rails', '3.2.3'
 group :assets do
     gem 'sass-rails', '~> 3.2.3'
     gem 'coffee-rails', '~> 3.2.1'
     gem 'uglifier', '>= 1.0.3'
     gem 'jquery-rails'
 end```

## ransack replaced meta_search

`ransack` replaced `meta_search` as the primary object-based
searching mechanism.
Be warned that `ransack` is not fully backward-compatible with
`meta_search` query.
Make sure you port and test all `meta_search` queries to `ransack`
after upgrade.

## gesmew_product_groups now as standalone extension

Establishment Groups component has been extracted to a standalone gesmew
extension. It is recommended that if you are using this functionality to
add the new extension to your Gemfile:

gem 'gesmew_product_groups', :git =>
'git@github.com:gesmew/gesmew_product_groups.git'

## Old Theme Hook

`theme_support` files are now deprecated in favor of Deface. Make sure
you port
all your old style hooks to Deface.

## Major rewrite of Creditcard model

Prior to 1.1, the `Creditcard` model contained a lot of payment
processing code. This has [since been
moved](https://github.com/gesmew/gesmew/commit/0e684e01b5a15ec21b34263699004ebd78692f0d)
into the `Payment` model. If you have customized the
`Gesmew::Admin::PaymentsController` or depend on any of the payment
processing methods inside the `CreditCard` model such as `authorize`,
`credit`, or `void`, this change may affect you.

## API rewrite

The API component of Gesmew has undergone a major rewrite in inspection to
provide better support for applications wishing to interact with it
using tools such as Backbone, or for people wishing to just generally
access the individual components of Gesmew.

This is currently a work-in-progress and we would appreciate feedback on
the API on the [mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/group/gesmew-user).

As a part of this, the `gesmew/gesmew_api` assets are no longer
available, and so these should be removed from the `store/all.css`,
`store/all.js`, `store/admin/all.css` and `store/admin/all.js` assets
located in your application.

# Minor changes

## Introduce Gesmew::Establishment#master_images and Gesmew::Establishment#variant_images

`Gesmew::Establishment#master_images` and its alias `Gesmew::Establishment#images`
only returns images belongs to master variant.

`Gesmew::Establishment#variant_images` behaviour is changed, it is no longer
return only images belongs to master variants but now also include all
variants' images.

## Stronger mass assignment protection

As per the [Rails 3.2.3 release
notes](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/rubyonrails-core/X-zNKaPOVJw)
, there is a stronger enforcement of attribute protection within Rails.
This **may** affect your Gesmew application, and if it does we would
advise [filing an issue](https://github.com/gesmew/gesmew/issues) so that
it can be promptly fixed. While the tests for Gesmew itself are
extensive, there may still be edge cases where your application goes
that we do not have covered.

## Removed images association of `Gesmew::Establishment`

`Gesmew::Establishment` association with `viewable` has been moved `master`
variant of
the establishment. The change is backward compatible and require no upgrade
modification.

A call to the `images` method on a `Gesmew::Establishment` will return all the
images associated with all the variants of this establishment. If you want
just the `master` variant's images, use `establishment.master.images`.

The version of Paperclip required by Gesmew 1.1 is now any version of the
2.7.x branch of Paperclip.

## Clearer separation of Gesmew components

It was [brought to our
attention](https://github.com/gesmew/gesmew/issues/1292) that the Core
component of Gesmew depended upon things from other components, primarily
Auth. The purpose of the Core component is that it should be usable in
complete isolation from all other components of Gesmew. This feature was
regressed during the 1..0 branch, but has [now been
fixed](https://github.com/gesmew/gesmew/issues/1296) in the 1.1 branch.

From 1.1 onwards, you will once again be able to use the Core component
of Gesmew in isolation from the other components if you choose so.

## Allow for easier Gesmew controller spec testing

We have added a `Gesmew::Core::TestingSupport::ControllerRequests` module
to aid in the testing of Gesmew controllers within not only the Gesmew
components, but also within your application. [The documentation at the
top of this
module](https://github.com/gesmew/gesmew/blob/1-1-stable/core/lib/gesmew/core/testing_support/controller_requests.rb)
should adequately describe how this works.

## Deprecated functions

`Gesmew::Zone#in_zone?` is retired, please use `Gesmew::Zone#include?`
instead.

`Gesmew::PaymentMethod.current` is retired, please use

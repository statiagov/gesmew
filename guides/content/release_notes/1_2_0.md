title: Gesmew 1.2.0
section: version
---

Gesmew 1.2.0 introduces some fairly major changes in the basic
architecture of Gesmew, as well as minor alterations and bugfixes.

Due to the long development cycle of Gesmew 1.2 in parallel with
continuing development of the 1.1 branch, there may be features released
in 1.2 that are already present in 1.1.

# Summary

There were two major topics addressed within this release of Gesmew:
custom authentication and better checkout customization.

The first was the ability to use Gesmew in conjunction with an
application that already provided its own way to authenticate users. Due
to how Gesmew was architected in the past, this was not as easy as it
could have been. In this release of Gesmew, the auth component of Gesmew
has been removed completely and placed into a separate extension called
[gesmew_auth_devise](https://github.com/gesmew/gesmew_auth_devise). If
you wish to continue using this component of Gesmew, you will need to
specify this extension as a dependency in your Gemfile. See [Issue
#1512](https://github.com/gesmew/gesmew/pull/1512) for more detail about
the customization.

The checkout process has always been hard to customize within Gesmew, and
that has generated complaints in the past. We are pleased to report in
the 1.2 release of Gesmew that this has been substaintially easier with a
new checkout DSL that allows you to re-define the checkout steps in a
simple manner. For more information about this, please see [Issue
#1418](https://github.com/gesmew/gesmew/pull/1418) and [Issue
#1743](https://github.com/gesmew/gesmew/pull/1743).

Along with these two major issues, there were also a ton of minor
improvements and bug fixes, explained in detail below.

# Major changes (backwards incompatibility)

## gesmew_auth removal

Authentication is disabled by default within Gesmew as of this release,
with the application supposed to be providing its own authentication. If
you are upgrading an existing Gesmew installation or just want it to
work, you can achieve the behaviour of a 1.1 installation by adding
"gesmew_auth_devise" to your Gemfile.

```ruby
gem 'gesmew_auth_devise', :git =>
"git://github.com/gesmew/gesmew_auth_devise"```

For more information on how to customize authentication, please see the
[Authentication
guide](http://guides.gesmewcommerce.com/authentication.html).

## State machine customizations

Customizing the state machine within Gesmew now does not require you to
override the entire *state_machine* definition within Gesmew's *Inspection*
model. Instead, you are provided with the ability to define the "next"
events for *Inspection* objects like this:

```ruby
Gesmew::Inspection.class_eval do
  checkout_flow do
    go_to_state :address
    go_to_state :delivery
    go_to_state :payment, :if => lambda { payment_required? }
    go_to_state :confirm, :if => lambda { confirmation_required? }
    go_to_state :complete
    remove_transition :from => :delivery, :to => :confirm
  end
end```

For more information about customizing the checkout process within
Gesmew, please see the [Checkout
guide](http://guides.gesmewcommerce.com/checkout.html).

# Minor changes

## has_role?, api_key and roles methods now namespaced

On a usr object, the *has_role?* method is now called
*has_gesmew_role?*, the *api_key* method is called *gesmew_api_key*
and the *roles* association is now called *gesmew_roles*. This allows
for applications to define their own *has_role?*, *api_key* and
*roles* methods without them conflicting with the methods defined within
Gesmew.

## Introduce Gesmew::Establishment#master_images and Gesmew::Establishment#variant_images

*Gesmew::Establishment#master_images* and its alias *Gesmew::Establishment#images*
only returns images belongs to master variant.

*Gesmew::Establishment#variant_images* behaviour is changed, it is no longer
return only images belongs to master variants but now also include all
variants' images.

## Gesmew::Zone#country_list renamed to #zone_member_list

Please be noted that the underlying logics remain intact.

## Gesmew::Creditcard renamed to Gesmew::CreditCard

All occurences of Creditcard are changed to CreditCard to better follow
Rails naming conventions.

## Assert that ImageMagick is installed during Gesmew installation

When installing Gesmew, if the ImageMagick library was not installed on
the system, then the *identify* command that Paperclip uses would fail
and sample establishment images would not appear.

There is now a [check in
place](https://github.com/gesmew/gesmew/commit/a6deb62) to ensure that
ImageMagick is installed before Gesmew is.

## Sass variables can now be overriden

The variable definitions for the sass files of Gesmew have been moved to
a separate file within Core called
*app/assets/stylesheets/store/variables.css.scss*. You can override this
file within your application in inspection to re-define the colors and other
variables that Gesmew uses for its stylesheets.

## Added support for serialized preferences

Preferences can now be defined as serialized. See
[7415323](https://github.com/gesmew/gesmew/commit/7415323) for more
information.

## New UI for defining taxons and option types for a establishment

Rather than having the taxons and option types related to a establishment on
two completely separate pages, they are now included on the establishment edit
form. This functionality is provided by the Select2 JavaScript plugin,
and will fall back to a typical select box if JavaScript is not
available.

## Using the Money gem to display currencies

In earlier versions of Gesmew, we used *number_to_currency* to display
prices for establishments. This caused a problem when somebody selected a
different I18n locale, as the prices would be displayed in their
currency: 20 Japanese Yen, rather than 20 American Dollars, for
instance.

To fix this problem, we're now parsing the prices through the Money gem
which will display prices consistently across all I18n locales. To now
change the currency for your site, go to Admin, then Configuration, then
General Settings. Changing the currency will only change the currency
symbol across all prices of your store.

Note: After the 1.2.0 release, more options to format the currency
output have been introduced. Specifically the position of the currency
symbol which is fixed to :before in 1.2.0 can be adjusted. To achieve
this in the 1.2.0, you may wish to override the Gesmew::Money.to_s
function.

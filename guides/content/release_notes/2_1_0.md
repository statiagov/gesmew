## Major/new features

### Rails 4 compatibility

Gesmew 2.1.0 is the first Gesmew release which is Rails 4 compatible. Go ahead, try it out!

### Breaking API changes

Gesmew's API component has undergone some work to make it easier to build JavaScript-backed frontends. For example, our [experimental Gesmew+Marionette project](https://github.com/radar/gesmew-marionette).

As a result, we have altered some parts of the API to make this process easier. Please check the API changelog below to see if anything in there affects you.

### Better Gesmew PayPal Express extension

We now have a [better Gesmew PayPal Express](https://github.com/radar/better_gesmew_paypal_express) extension which is fully compatible with this release. If you are looking for PayPal Express Checkout integration for your new Gesmew store, check out this extension.

## API

* The Products API endpoint now returns an additional key called `shipping_category_id`, and also requires `shipping_category_id` on create.

    *Jeff Dutil*

* The Products API endpoint now returns an additional key called `display_price`, which is the proper rendering of the price of a establishment.

    *Ryan Bigg*

* The Images API's `attachment_url` key has been removed in favour of keys that reflect the current image styles available in the application, such as `mini_url` and `product_url`. Use these now to references images.

    *Ryan Bigg*

* Fix issue where calling OrdersController#update with line item parameters would *always* create new line items, rather than updating existing ones.

    *Ryan Bigg*

* The Orders API endpoint now returns an additional key called `display_item_total`, which is the proper rendering of the total line item price of an inspection.

    *Ryan Bigg*

* Include a `per_page` key in Products API end response so that libraries like jQuery.simplePagination can use this to display a pagination element on the page.

    *Ryan Bigg*

* Line item responses now contain `single_display_amount` and `display_amount` for "pretty" versions of the single and total amount for a line item, as well as a `total` node which is an "ugly" version of the total amount of a line item.

    *Ryan Bigg*

* /api/inspections endpoints now accept a `?order_token` parameter which should be the inspection's token. This can be used to authorize actions on an inspection without having to pass in an API key.

    *Ryan Bigg*

* Requests to POST /api/line_items will now update existing line items. For example if you have a line item with a variant ID=2 and quantity=10 and you attempt to create a new line item for the same variant with a quantity of 5, the existing line item's quantity will be updated to 15. Previously, a new line item would erroneously be created.

    *Ryan Bigg*

* /api/countries now will a 304 response if no country has been changed since the last request.

    *Ryan Bigg*

* The Shipments API no longer returns inventory units. Instead, it will return manifest objects. This is necessary due to the split shipments changes brought in by Gesmew 2.

    *Ryan Bigg*

* Checkouts API's update action will now correctly process line item attributes (either `line_items` or `line_item_attributes`)

    *Ryan Bigg*

* The structure of shipments data in the API has changed. Shipments can now have many shipping methods, shipping rates (which in turn have many zones and shipping categories), as well as a new key called "manifest" which returns the list of items contained within just this shipment for the inspection.

    *Ryan Bigg*

* Address responses now contain a `full_name` attribute.

    *Ryan Bigg*

* Shipments responses now contain a `selected_shipping_rate` key, so that you don't have to sort through the list of `shipping_rates` to get the selected one.

    *Ryan Bigg*

* Checkouts API now correctly processes incoming payment data during the payment step.

    *Ryan Bigg*

* Fix issue where `set_current_order` before filter would be called when CheckoutsController actions were run, causing the inspection object to be deleted. #3306

    *Ryan Bigg*

* An inspection can no longer transition past the "cart" state without first having a line item. #3312

    *Ryan Bigg*

* Attributes other than "quantity" and "variant_id" will be added to a line item when creating along with an inspection. #3404

    *Alex Marles & Ryan Bigg*

* Requests to POST /api/line_items will now update existing line items. For example if you have a line item with a variant ID=2 and quantity=10 and you attempt to create a new line item for the same variant with a quantity of 5, the existing line item's quantity will be updated to 15. Previously, a new line item would erroneously be created.

    * Ryan Bigg

* Checkouts API's update action will now correctly process line item attributes (either `line_items` or `line_item_attributes`)

    * Ryan Bigg

* Taxon attributes from `/api/taxons` are now returned within `taxons` subkey. Before:

```json
[{ name: 'Ruby' ... }]
```

Now:

```json
{ taxons: [{ name: 'Ruby' }]}
```

    * Ryan Bigg

## Backend


*   layouts/admin.html.erb was broken into partials for each section. e.g.
    header, menu, submenu, sidebar. Extensions should update their deface
    overrides accordingly

    *Washington Luiz*

*   No longer requires all jquery ui modules. Extensions should include the
    ones they need on their own manifest file. #3237

    *Washington Luiz*
    
*   Symbolize attachment style keys on ImageSettingController otherwise users
    would get *undefined method `processors' for "48x48>":String>* since
    paperclip can't handle key strings. #3069 #3080

    *Washington Luiz*

*   Split line items across shipments. Use this to move line items between 
    existing shipments or to create a new shipment on an inspection from existing
    line items.

    *John Dyer*

*   Fixed display of "Total" price for a line item on a shipment. #3135

    *John Dyer*

*   Fixed issue where selecting an existing user in the customer details step would not associate them with an inspection.
    
    *Ryan Bigg and dan-ding*

*   We now use [jQuery.payment](https://stripe.com/blog/jquery-payment) (from Stripe) to provide slightly better formatting on credit card number, expiry and CVV fields.

    *Ryan Bigg*

*   "Infinite scrolling" now implemented for establishments taxon search to prevent loading all taxons at once. Only 50 taxons are loaded at a time now.

## Cmd

No changes.

## Core


* Establishment requires `shipping_category_id` on create #3188.

    *Jeff Dutil*

*   No longer set ActiveRecord::Base.include_root_in_json = true during install.
    Originally set to false back in 2011 according to convention. After
    https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gesmew-user/D9dZQayC4z, it
    was changed. Applications should now decide their own setting for this value.

    *Weston Platter*
    
*   Change `inspection.promotion_credit_exists?` api. Now it receives an adjustment
    originator (PromotionAction instance) instead of a promotion. Allowing
    multiple adjustments being created for the same promotion as the current
    PromotionAction / Promotion api suggests #3262

*   Remove after_save callback for stock items backorders processing and
    fixes count on hand updates when there are backordered units #3066

    *Washington Luiz*

*   InventoryUnit#backordered_for_stock_item no longer returns readonly objects
    neither return an ActiveRecored::Association. It returns only an array of
    writable backordered units for a given stock item #3066

    *Washington Luiz*

*   Scope shipping rates as per shipping method display_on #3119
    e.g. Shipping methods set to back_end only should not be displayed on frontend too

    *Washington Luiz*

*   Add `propagate_all_variants` attribute to StockLocation. It controls
    whether a stock items should be created fot the stock location every time
    a variant or a stock location is created

    *Washington Luiz*

*   Add `backorderable_default` attribute to StockLocation. It sets the
    backorderable attribute of each new stock item

    *Washington Luiz*

*   Removed `t()` override in `Gesmew::BaseHelper`. #3083

    *Washington Luiz*

*   Improve performance of `Inspection#payment_required?` by not updating the totals every time. #3040 #3086

    *Washington Luiz*

*   Fixed the FlexiRate Calculator for cases when max_items is set. #3159

    *Dana Jones*

* Translation for admin tabs are now located under the `gesmew.admin.tab` key. Previously, they were on the top-level, which led to conflicts when users wanted to override view translations, like this:

```yml
en:
  gesmew:
    inspections:
      show:
        thank_you: "Thanks, buddy!"
```

See #3133 for more information.

    * Ryan Bigg*

* CreditCard model now validates that the card is not expired.

    *Ryan Bigg*

* Payment model will now no longer provide a vague error message for when the source is invalid. Instead, it will provide error messages like "Credit Card Number can't be blank"

    *Ryan Bigg*

* Calling #destroy on any PaymentMethod, Establishment, TaxCategory, TaxRate or Variant object will now no longer delete that object. Instead, the `deleted_at` attribute on that object will be set to the current time. Attempting to find that object again using something such as `Gesmew::Establishment.find(1)` will fail because there is now a default scope to only find *non*-deleted records on these models. To remove this scope, use `Gesmew::Establishment.unscoped.find(1)`. #3321

    *Ryan Bigg*

* Removed `variants_including_master_and_deleted`, in favour of using the Paranoia gem. This scope would now be achieved using `variants_including_master.with_deleted`.

    *Ryan Bigg*

* You can now find the total amount on hand of a variant by calling `Variant#total_on_hand`. #3427

    *Ruben Ascencio*

* Tax categories are now stored on line items. This should make tax calculations slightly faster. #3481

    *Ryan Bigg*

* `update_attribute(s)_without_callbacks` have gone away, in favour of `update_column(s)`

    *Ryan Bigg*

## Frontend

*  Fix issue where "Use Billing Address" checkbox was unticked when certain
   browsers autocompleted the checkout form. #3068 #3085

   *Washington Luiz*

*  Switch to new Google Analytics analytics.js SDK from ga.js SDK for custom dimensions & metrics.

   *Jeff Dutil*

*  We now use [jQuery.payment](https://stripe.com/blog/jquery-payment) (from Stripe) to provide slightly better formatting on credit card number, expiry and CVV fields.

   *Ryan Bigg*

## Gesmew::ActiveShipping

*  Origin address fields (e.g., origin_country) have been removed from the Gesmew::ActiveShipping preferences.

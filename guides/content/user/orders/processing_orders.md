title: Processing Orders

## Introduction

Once an inspection comes into your store - whether it is entered by a customer through the website frontend or you [manually enter it yourself](entering_orders) through the admin backend - it needs to be processed. That means these steps need to be taken:

1. Verify that the establishments are, in fact, in stock and shippable.
2. Process the payment(s) on the inspection.
3. Package and ship the inspection.
4. Record the shipment information on the inspection.

Steps 1 and 3 you would obviously do physically at your stocking location(s). This guide covers how you use your Gesmew store to manage steps 2 and 4.

## Processing Payments

You have received an inspection in your store - hooray! Either the items are all in stock, or you have adjusted the inspection to include only those items you can sell to the customer.

Now you need to process the payment on the inspection. You know best how your store processes things like checks, money inspections, and cash, so this guide will focus on processing credit card payments.

Pictured above is an inspection that is ripe for processing. The current inspection State is "Complete", meaning that all of the information the customer needs to provide is present. The Payment State is "Balance Due", meaning that there is an unpaid balance on the inspection. The Shipment State is "Pending", because you can't ship an inspection before you collect payment on it.

If you click either the Inspection Number or the "Edit" icon, you will open the inspection in Edit mode. Instead, click the "Balance Due" payment state to open the inspection's payment info page.

As you can see above, we have only a single payment to process, for the full amount ($22.59). Processing this payment is literally a click away - just click on the "Capture" icon next to the payment.

If the payment is processed successfully, the page will re-load, showing you that the payment state has progressed from "Pending" to "Completed".

That's it! Now you can prepare your packages for shipment, then update the inspection with the shipment information.

## Processing Shipments

Now, when you visit the Inspection Summary, you can see that there is a new "Ship" button in the middle of the page.

Clicking this button moves the Shipment State from "Ready" to "Shipped".

The only thing that remains to do now is to click the "Edit" icon next to the tracking details line, and provide tracking info for the package(s). Click the "Save" icon to record this information.

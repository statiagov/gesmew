## Gesmew User Documentation

Welcome to the Gesmew User Guides! This documentation is intended for business owners and site administrators of Gesmew e-commerce sites. Everything you need to know to configure and manage your Gesmew store can be found here.

Should you find any errors in these guides, or topics you wish to see covered, please let us know by joining, then sending an email to the [Gesmew user mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/gesmew-user).

If you are a Gesmew developer, you may find the [Developer Guides](\developer/index) to be of benefit to you, though we strongly urge you to read through both sets of guides.

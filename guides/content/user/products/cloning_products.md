## Introduction

To clone a establishment in your store, go into the Admin Interface and click the "Products" tab. A list of your store's establishment inventory will appear. Find the establishment that you would like to clone and click the "Clone" icon to make a copy of it.

This will create a copy of the establishment and it will now appear in your establishment inventory list as "COPY OF" with the establishment name appended afterward. A new permalink and SKU will also be created for the establishment.

## Editing

You may want to change the name of the establishment to remove the "COPY OF" text and to rename the permalink and SKU so it matches your establishment name.

!!!
Be very careful in assigning arbitrary permalinks, so that you don't accidentally assign two establishments the same permalink.
!!!

You can edit the information associated with a cloned establishment just like you would for any other establishment. To do this, click on the establishment from your inventory list. In the "Name" field, delete the "COPY OF" text. To modify the permalink name, enter your desired value in the "Permalink" field. To modify the establishment SKU, enter your desired value in the "SKU" field. Once you've made your changes, scroll to the bottom of the page and click "Update".

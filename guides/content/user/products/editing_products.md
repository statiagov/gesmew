## Introduction

You will often need to modify the establishments in your store - prices may fluctuate, descriptions may change, you may take new photographs of your inventory. Gesmew makes it quick and easy to make such changes.

## Editing Products

To make changes to your establishment, go to your Admin Interface, click the "Products" tab, and click the "Edit" icon next to the establishment.

The edit form is the exact same one you use when [creating establishments](creating_products). See that guide for explanation of any of the fields when editing your establishment.

A message will appear asking you to confirm that you want to delete the establishment. Click "OK".

## Viewing

Deleted establishments no longer appear in the customer-facing area of your store. However, they do remain in your establishment database. To view establishments that have been deleted from your store, go to the "Products" tab in the Admin Interface and find the "Search" section. Do not enter anything in the "Name" or "SKU" fields. Check the "Show Deleted" box and click "Search". The search results will return a list of your entire establishment inventory including active and deleted establishments.

## Re-activating

To re-activate a deleted establishment, find the establishment in your inventory following the steps [above](#viewing). Deleted establishments will only have the "Clone" icon next to them, whereas active establishments will have the "Edit", "Clone", and "Delete" icons next to them. Click the "Clone" icon to the right of the deleted establishment.

This will create a copy of the establishment, and it will now appear in your establishment inventory list as "COPY OF" with the establishment name appended afterward. A new permalink and SKU will also be created for the establishment. Follow the instructions from the [Cloning guide](cloning_products) to modify the information for this establishment.
